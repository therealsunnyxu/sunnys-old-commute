# Sunny's Old Commute
## Description
This Python command-line interactive story shows what my commute used to look like in 2019.
## Installation Instructions
1. Install Python 3 on your machine of choice and set it up to work in command-line.
2. Download "main_fsm.py" to a directory
3. Navigate to the directory in the command line, then execute command "python main_fsm.py"
## Opportunities
I developed this text-based story in 3 hours as a demonstration of a naive implementation of finite-state machines. Further implementations can improve upon this design. Instead of hard-coding the story's text and prompts, the Story class should parse a JSON file containing the story's text and prompts. This will allow the program to allow the user to read different interactive stories and minimize redundant if-statements.
